# Phase 3:  Formal Presentation and Evaluation  
# The student will prepare a 10 minute slideshow presentation. This will be presented before a panel followed by a 10 minute question and answer session.  
# The presentation for the panel will include video and/or photographic evidence from multiple stages of their project. The rationale behind the project selection should be explained, along with a detailed explanation of what their project entailed, how the student accomplished this, and what they have learned through this process.
# Following the presentation the panel and audience will pose questions to the student. They should be prepared to discuss challenges that they faced, community connections that they developed, and advice they would pass on for others interested in similar endeavors.

# Are you talking about computers? I know what they are.

- Letters go into boxes.
- And when it's a toss up, just Googleâ„¢ it!
- Actually, there's a little bit more to it than that.
- Have you ever wondered what happens between turning the computer on and crossing off some words?

# The Computer:

Meet Craig! He's a computer. However, he's basically useless without all his friends (that live inside him).

![Craig](img/craig.png)

<!--I was told that naming him would make the audience attached, and cause them to feel emotionally damaged when I killed him later. I'm going for a where the red fern grows type vibe, ya feel?-->

# Craig's friends

Inside Craig, we can find:
- Carmen, the **CPU**, she's the brains of the bunch and can do a bunch of calculations.
- Rico, the **RAM**, he stores all the maths that Carmen will do.
- Harvey, the **Hard Drive**, they store all of the files for the computer.
- Geraldo, the **GPU**, he draws all the little boxes and letters for the crossword.
- Martha, the **Motherboard**, she is like the glue that ties all the parts together.

# But what of this thing called Software?

No, it's not soft. It's the code that Craig runs! He needs some sort of instructions in order to know what to do.

The different pieces of software we are concerened about here are:
* The **BIOS**. This is the *first* thing that runs when the computer turns on. It's called  Basic Input Output System for a reason though, as it is basically useless to the end-user.
* The **Bootloader**. OOOie! This gets a little more spicy as it has to setup the computer and load in the operating system.

::right::

  style krn fill:#8bf8f9
  style chrome fill:#f9f08b
  style csgo fill:#d1d1d1
  style mspaint fill:#f98bf8
```

* The **Kernel**. The nuts and bolts of the operating system. It's not talked about a lot but it is the most important piece of software in your computer. NOTHING can happen without one.

<!--The BIOS initializes all the parts of the system. That's Carmen, Geraldo, Harvey, Martha, and Rico. It makes sure everything works and sets any hardware level settings. It will then exhaustively search all connected storage devices for a bootable medium before passing it off to the bootloader. The bootloader then prepares the computer for the operating system. It's kinda a toss up for what functionality is put into the bootloader and what gets thrown into later stages but a basic bootloader will transition the computer to x32 bit mode, query the computer for the amount of ram and other capabilities and then load and execute a kernel. The kernel's job is to make nice abstractions for the programs to use.-->

# One more thing.
What's an operating system?

An operating system is the collection of software that runs on your computer. It's basically everything your computer needs to run. 

It includes:
- the kernel
- your settings app
- the command prompt/terminal
- etc.

Some good examples are Windows, Mac or GNU/Linux.

---
layout: statement
---

# Clear as mud? All you need know is that a kernel is the lowest piece of software in an operating system and takes care of extremely basic tasks.

---
layout: default
---

# So then, what, exactly, did I do as an Honors project?

I made an operating system!

No, I'm not reinventing the wheel. I think modern operating systems haven't significantly changed in the last few decades. There are a lot of new ideas in OS development that can increase the speed of the system or increase the customization offered. 

Research out of MIT has shown the exokernel as a potential option for future innovation (Engler et al., 1995). So that was the direction of study for my Honors project.

---
layout: two-cols
---

# What is this? X O Kernel?

I know, I know, you probably have a lot of questions right now.

- An exo-kernel is a slimmed down version of a kernel.
- This allows the applications to have more control over the computer if they wish.
- It also allows competing environments to exist on the same computer. (i.e. theoretically Windows and Mac apps could run TOGETHER)
- The exokernel provides the *bare-minimum* security in order to split the hardware resources between applications. (*multiplexing*)

::right::

- Much of the previously provided functionality is moved to a library operating system. It's called a library because it can be reused by many applications and it's called an operating system because it implements things like a filesystem, device drivers and the networking stack.

---
layout: default
---

# Why did I choose this project?

- I have had previous experience with low level stuff.
- I love analyzing the interactions between hardware and software.
- It is kinda the wildwest of computer science. The only people you can rely on are those that have walked the path before.
- It is also extremely applicable to my hopeful future as a mechanical engineer. 

<!--You haven't lived unless your researching the difference between a PIC and PIT at 2 am in the morning.-->

# Design
Baby steps, baby steps.

- Designing an exokernel is a difficult job.
- It's not like a regular kernel where you know you have to provide a few facilities to the applications (filesystems, mouse/keyboard interaction, drawing to teh screen)
- Instead, you have to find a good balance between security and accessibility.
- I also knew that I was probably going to change the design for the kernel multiple times over the course of the project.
- How do I allow the applications to choose how they want to use the hardrive, but also prevent them from encroaching on each other's storage space?

---
layout: default

# Boot stage
Beep boop, let's load it up!

I decided not to implement a custom bootloader this time. It simply wasn't worth it as compared with high-quality options such as GRUB2. But I did make a nice boot theme: [PICTURE REDACTED]

However, GRUB doesn't do all the work for me. I still have to switch the computer from the ancient, archaic and creepy x32 bit mode to the modern, subliminal and (dare I say it) sexy x64 bit mode.

I also have to choose what software to start up on boot because a kernel without any applications is like a ship without a wheel.

Some difficulties arose from this stage. Particularly transitioning the kernel from x32 to x64 bit mode because it requires a lot of extra work with memory for the developer.

---
layout: default
---

# The Exokernel's responsibilities

After getting the computer to boot, it was time to implement sections of the exokernel. This focus was on securely multiplexing the different resource the computer had to offer. 

I knew a lot of this might change later. Afterall, I wanted to keep the kernel as slim as possible whilst also protecting against malware.

This led to a lot of back and forth, especially with how the computer deals with memory. I need to implement paging structures in order to setup x64 mode, but I don't want to disallow the library operating systems from controlling some parts of how virtual memory works.

---
layout: default
---

# A Unix Library Operating System
An age-old tradition

- Unix is an old standard for operating systems.
- A lot of software is built to run in a Unix environment.
- Therefore, getting a Unix environment working would allow me to avoid a lot of duplicate effort for many common computer programs.
- This was also the first real test of the exokernel. 
- During this stage, there was a lot of going back and forth in order to control what is implemented in the exokernel and what is implemented in the library os.

---
layout: default
---

# Some User-space programs
Finally, something the user can see.

- These are your web browsers, email clients, and command lines.
- They allow you to interact with your computer. 
- Again, since I had built a Unix environment, many unix programs were able to run on the computer.
- This includes things like sed and grep.
- I had to implement video drivers for this stage.

---
layout: default
---

# Strengths/Weaknesses

- A large strength in my project was the background I had in working with operating systems.
- However, throughout the project, I learned how little I truly knew.
- I think a large weakness I had going into the project was focusing on long term goals. I'd never really attempted a computing project of this size, and therefore it was a little difficult to not get distracted by other computing ideas I found interesting.
- I learned a lot about time-management and persistence through the project.

---
layout: default
---

# Where do I go from here?

- Next year I'm going to ISU with a major in Mechanical Engineering.
- I will certainly keep programming as a side-hobby and I might turn this into a functional product.
- I think this project gave me a great experience with low-level coding that I can use in ME.
